Name: Jayani Sivakumar

## Log (to be completed as you work on the project)

*  2/27 Attended Dr. Sykes' office hours to ask about test cases failing as they seemed correct to me and I was unsure why they were failing. He mentioned how there should be spaces at the end of the first line fo rthe squares method, but that didn't work. Said he'll clarify with instructor and post on Piazza.
*  2/27 Attended Dr. Grover's office hours to ask the same problem I was facing before as the before TA said he would post the answer to my query on Piazza but he didn't. This time I got the square methods test to pass.
*  2/28 Attended Dr. Scott's office hours to get clarification on why diamond method tests were failing and made changes to code.
*  2/28 Asked Dr. Grover in class about what was going wrong with my Triangle method and explained to me how it was supposed to work.
*  2/28 Attended Dr. Shen's office hours to get advice on why Triangle method tests were failing and got to see where I was going wrong, due to not having spaces printed in the first row.
