Your goal is to create a Java application that will manage the sales of movie tickets in a cinema complex. The complex consists of several theaters that show movies at different times. The same movie may be showing in more than one theater. 

The ticket prices may be different for children, adults, and seniors. There may also be a different price for the matinees. 

The cinema complex wants to be able to analyze its sales by various criteria - tickets sold to seniors, tickets for a specific movie, etc.

Some cinema complexes may also have luxury theaters with higher fixed price for all patrons.

## Update

A fourth ticket price category has been added for matinees. The complex wants to make sure that they store the title, length, genre, and rating for each movie. The complex also wants to be able to output reports to files.
