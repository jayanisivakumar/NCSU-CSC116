## Movie Theatre Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Our requirements:
A program that can manage the sales of a movie theater complex with varying prices based on type of tickets, type of movie, and type of theater.
The system shall allow several theaters that show movies at different times
The system shall handle the same movie showing in more than one theater
The system shall have different prices for children, adults, and seniors.
The system should account for a different price for matinees.
The system should allow the complex owners to keep track of tickets sold for each age, movie, and theater.
The system should create higher fixed prices for luxury theaters.
The system should store the title, length, genre and rating for each movie.

How we met our requirements:
In our project, we've met our requirements by carefully designing and implementing key features. For example, in the Theater class, we ensured that each theater is represented accurately with attributes like theaterNumber, theaterName, and isLuxury. This allows users to select different theaters based on their preferences.

Similarly, in the Movie class, we focused on providing accurate information about each movie, including its title, duration, and showtimes. This helps users to see what movies are available and when they can watch them.

In the CinemagicClient class, we created a user-friendly interface that guides users through theater and movie selections. We also included a ticket price calculation feature, allowing users to see the cost of their movie tickets based on different factors. We also have a file that will provide the analysis of ticket sales.

Overall, by addressing these requirements in our classes and client interface, we've ensured that our project meets the expectations of providing a functional and user-friendly movie theater experience.


How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

We applied various pre-lab concepts listed below:
Scanner input from the console:
Scanner input will be used to get information used to calculate the price of the ticket sale
Objects:
We need to create a movie object, and theater object to store the information regarding each. 
Arrays:
Each theater object will have an array of movie objects indicating which movies are playing at a given theater. 
The movie object will have a showtimes array that stores integers for their showtimes.
File Processing:
Printwriter: We will need to use a printwriter object to store the information for each ticket sale in a separate file.
We will use file processing to record the ticket sales of each theater on a given day for the program to read and interpret.
We will use file processing so analyze data stored in files regarding past ticket sales


What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

This is a new experience as it's the first time we are documenting the requirements, design, implementation and testing completely by ourselves and coming up with a working program within a limited time. As for implementation and testing, we used prior knowledge and didn't have to learn anything new.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.
14950 minutes.
